# CNN-MNIST

Implemented and trained a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). Wrote my own code for convolutions (e.g., no use SciPy's convolution function). The convolution network had a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It achieved 97% accuracy on the Test Set.
